                <p><strong>Sir Tim Berners-Lee</strong> invented the World Wide Web in 1989.</p>
                <p>He was born in 1955 in London, England. His parents were computer scientists who worked on early computers. Eventually, he went on to study at Oxford and earned a degree in physics.</p>
                <p>Later, he worked as an independent contractor at CERN, which a particle physics laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland.</p>
                <p>While at CERN, in 1980, he proposed his <em>hypertext</em> project as a way to share information among researchers. This was the first iteration of what we now call the World Wide Web.</p>
                <p>He later left and finally returned to CERN in 1989, where he brought together a few different ideas, such as the domain name system, and the TCP protocol, to build a new kind of way to navigate the Internet. Thus the World Wide Web was born.</p>
                <p>Berners-Lee has spent much of the rest of his career working to pioneer and refine policy that would govern how the Web works and how it would be regulated.</p>
